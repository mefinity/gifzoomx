## **Why I made this**
This project started because of Artist converting their images into GIF formats to combat AI usage of their work, this extension restores access to fullscreen/maximizing media for your viewing pleasure.  
_This extension is not meant to bypass Artist using the GIF format to combat against AI, as the AI "Edit image" button still remains absent._

## **Usage**
- Click a GIF on Twitter.
- Scroll to zoom.
- Drag to pan when zoomed.
- Double-click to reset zoom.
- Press Escape or click the background to close.
